    <div class="title"> IT Intern | Lavner Education </div> 
    <div class="description">
      During the summer of 2023, I had the rewarding opportunity to contribute to the growth and development of the next wave of <br>engineers and coders in my role as an IT Intern at Lavner Education. This experience encompassed a broad spectrum of <br>technology-focused learning environments, including courses in Java and C++, as well as sessions devoted to the intriguing world <br>of robotics.
      <br>
      While this intensive, hands-on experience deepened my technical knowledge and enhanced my practical skill set, the real growth <br>occurred in my ability to effectively communicate complex information. The challenge of explaining intricate coding concepts to <br>young, eager minds demanded that I develop innovative, accessible, and comprehensible teaching methods. The techniques I <br>honed during this period enabled me to break down advanced concepts into understandable segments.
      <br>
      Consequently, this internship was not just an exercise in expanding my technical proficiency, but a journey into understanding the <br>art of teaching. The skills I acquired in the process have not only enriched my expertise but have also elevated my capacity to <br>inspire future tech enthusiasts.
